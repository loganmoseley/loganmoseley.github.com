				<h2>Faye's Shift</h2></center>
				
				<p>Play as Faye in a 2.5D platformer in which you phase between the lava 
				and ice phases in order to navigate past obstacles and progress through the 
				world. The two phases have distinct personalities, including art and enemies.</p>
				
				<p>All art was done in Photoshop, matted onto planes in Maya, and each asset imported 
				as a single mesh into Unity. Animations were done by separating each piece of the 
				character into limbs and IKs and animating as if they were standard 3D meshes.</p>
				
				<p>Download some builds below:
				No setup is required, just run "Faye's Shift.exe" or "Faye's Shift * (OS X).app". 
				"Faye's Shift.zip" also contains other important documents... (The poster and a readme.)</p>
				
				<p>My apologies to those running Macs, I am only serving the basic build for OS X 
				right now. Please contact me directly if you would like a version not currently hosted.</p>
